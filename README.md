# Association between APOL1 risk variants and the occurrence of sepsis in Black patients hospitalized with infections: a retrospective cohort study

In this retrospective cohort study of Black patients hospitalized with infections, we assessed whether carriage of APOL1 high-risk genotypes was associated with the risk of sepsis and sepsis-related phenotypes in Black patients hospitalized with infections, particularly after accounting for pre-existing renal disease.

Exposure: APOL1 high-risk genotypes

Primary outcome: sepsis

Secondary outcomes: 1) organ failure related to sepsis; 2) short-term mortality
